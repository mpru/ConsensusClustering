Description: Consensus Clustering is a revised tool for implementing the
    methodology for class discovery and clustering validation, based off of 2003
    Monti's paper. This method is used to find a consensus assignment across
    multiple runs of a clustering approach, allowing one to assess and validate the
    stability of the discovered clusters empirically. The objective of this method
    is to identify robust clusters in the context of genomic data, but is applicable
    for any unsupervised learning task.
